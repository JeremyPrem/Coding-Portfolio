GoHealth
-Final Project for CMSC434 @ UMD, contains code for a browser app that allows people to log their height, weight, health goals, and experience levels. The app will then create meal plans, excersize plans, and daily health tips for the user to follow in their everyday schedule. This app also allows users to chart their progress and enter in their schedule so that the app can generate a schedule for working out and healthy habits that fit within the user's schedule.
